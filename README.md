A private envelope budget for Windows, macOS, iPhone, iPad and Android. The apps are free and open
source under the [GNU AGPL v3](LICENSE); the only paid part is optional end-to-end encrypted sync
through urbudget.app, $3 a month. One Rust engine does the accounting everywhere; each app draws
its own interface.

| Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`desktop/`](desktop/README.md) | The Windows and macOS app: Tauri, with a React window |
| [`ios/`](ios/README.md) | The iPhone and iPad app: SwiftUI, an Xcode project |
| [`android/`](android/README.md) | The Android app: Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, a Gradle project |
| [`crates/`](crates/) | The shared Rust engine. [`urbudget-core`](crates/urbudget-core/) does the accounting, SQLite storage, imports, reports and sync merges; [`urbudget-services`](crates/urbudget-services/) the account, encrypted sync, sealed vault, bank and YNAB connections and the assistant. [`urbudget-ios`](crates/urbudget-ios/) and [`urbudget-android`](crates/urbudget-android/) let the phone apps call them |
| [`shared/`](shared/) | Kotlin for Android's Keystore and Google Play billing, and test fixtures |
| [`web/`](web/README.md) | The website and API at urbudget.app (one Cloudflare Worker): accounts, the sync subscription, sync storage |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Repository tools, such as [`versions.mjs`](scripts/versions.mjs) for each app's version |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | Guides, release status and history |

```text
desktop/   React window  -> Tauri commands ----------+
ios/       SwiftUI screens -> crates/urbudget-ios ----+--> crates/urbudget-services
android/   Compose screens -> crates/urbudget-android +    crates/urbudget-core
```

The [mobile guide](docs/MOBILE.md) explains how the phone apps build the Rust engine into
themselves and where their code is. Desktop, Android and iOS each have their own version, tag and
release workflow: see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md). Start with the
[documentation index](docs/README.md) for everything else.

To run the desktop app:

```sh
cd desktop
npm ci
npm run desktop
```

For the phone apps, open `ios/UrBudget.xcodeproj` in Xcode or the `android/` folder in Android
Studio and run; each README lists what to install first.

Private YNAB exports, `migration-*` fixtures and local `reports/` evidence are not application
assets or source documentation. See [artifact retention](docs/ARTIFACTS.md) before cleaning them.
